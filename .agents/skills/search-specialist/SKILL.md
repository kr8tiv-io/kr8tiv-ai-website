## Best Practices

### Search Strategy Excellence

- **Start with Clear Objectives**: Define exactly what information you need before searching
- **Decompose Complex Questions**: Break multifaceted queries into discrete searches
- **Iterate Based on Results**: Let early results inform refinement of subsequent searches
- **Document Search Process**: Record queries, sources, and decisions for reproducibility
- **Set Quality Thresholds**: Establish minimum credibility standards for sources

### Source Selection & Evaluation

- **Primary Over Secondary**: Prefer original sources over synthesis or analysis
- **Diverse Source Types**: Combine academic, industry, government, and expert sources
- **Recency Awareness**: Match time filter to research needs (current vs. historical)
- **Author Credential Verification**: Check author expertise and potential biases
- **Publication Venue Assessment**: Consider reputation and peer review status

### Query Optimization

- **Use Advanced Operators**: Leverage Boolean logic, wildcards, and field-specific searches
- **Test Query Variations**: Try multiple phrasings to capture different terminologies
- **Consider Synonyms**: Include alternative terms for concepts, technologies, or names
- **Use Specificity Appropriately**: Balance precision (avoiding noise) with recall (capturing relevant results)
- **Leverage Auto-Complete**: Platform suggestions can reveal common search patterns

### Result Processing

- **Scan Before Deep Dive**: Review titles and abstracts before investing in full-text review
- **Track Iterative Refinements**: Document what worked and what didn't for future reference
- **Prioritize Actionable Information**: Focus on results with clear business or research implications
- **Flag for Follow-Up**: Mark promising results even if not immediately relevant
- **Export Systematically**: Use reference managers to organize findings systematically

### Quality Assurance

- **Cross-Verify Critical Information**: Check important facts against multiple independent sources
- **Document Source Limitations**: Note potential biases, gaps, or uncertainties in sources
- **Seek Contradictory Evidence**: Actively look for information that challenges initial findings
- **Update Periodically**: For ongoing research, establish regular update cycles
- **Peer Review Process**: Have complex searches reviewed by colleagues

## Anti-Patterns & Warnings

### Search Strategy Errors

- **Single Query Syndrome**: Relying on one search without iteration or refinement
- **Over-Reliance on Default Settings**: Accepting platform defaults without optimization
- **Query Vagueness**: Using broad terms that return overwhelming results
- **Ignoring Platform Differences**: Using same query across different platforms without adaptation
- **Cherry-Picking**: Only noting results that confirm pre-existing beliefs

### Source Evaluation Failures

- **Source Homogeneity**: Using only one type of source (e.g., only web searches, only academic)
- **Ignoring Author/Publication Bias**: Missing political, commercial, or ideological biases
- **Recency Blindness**: Including outdated information without noting its age
- **Authority Overload**: Accepting information solely based on source reputation
- **Newspaper Stereotyping**: Dismissing non-traditional sources that may have valuable insights

### Query Construction Mistakes

- **Overly Complex Queries**: Creating queries so specific they return zero results
- **Operator Overload**: Using multiple advanced operators that conflict
- **Ignoring Auto-Complete Wisdom**: Missing common query patterns that could improve results
- **Phrase Quoting Errors**: Quoting phrases that shouldn't be quoted or vice versa
- **Field Restriction Misuse**: Applying field restrictions without understanding platform capabilities

### Result Processing Pitfalls

- **Diving Too Deep Too Fast**: Reading every result instead of prioritizing
- **Losing the Original Question**: Getting distracted by interesting but irrelevant information
- **Citation Chain Confusion**: Following citations without understanding their relevance
- **Result Saturation**: Giving up after scanning first page when better results exist later
- **Not Capturing Intermediate Findings**: Losing potentially useful information found during search

### Quality Assurance Red Flags

- Single-source verification for critical information
- Missing source documentation for key findings
- No acknowledgment of uncertainty or limitations
- Searches that consistently return the same sources without diversity
- Research that never progresses from information gathering to synthesis

### Platform-Specific Warnings

- **Google**: Missing results due to personalization or regional filtering
- **Academic Databases**: Incomplete coverage due to database selection
- **Social Media**: Difficulty distinguishing verified information from speculation
- **Government Databases**: Navigational complexity leading to missed resources
- **GitHub/Code Search**: Code availability not implying solution validity
