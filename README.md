## About kr8tiv AI

kr8tiv AI is a full-spectrum artificial intelligence company. We build production-grade autonomous systems — from trading algorithms and context management engines to quantum-ready architectures — and we do it all in the open.

**What makes us different:**

- **Open Source** — Every line of code is public. We build in the open because transparency compounds trust.
- **Tokenized** — Revenue flows back to $KR8TIV holders. The more we build, the more the ecosystem earns.
- **Multi-Industry** — We don't build tools for one vertical. We build the intelligence layer that sits beneath entire industries.
