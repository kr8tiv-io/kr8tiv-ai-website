## Best Practices

### Analysis Excellence

- **Document Assumptions**: Always record the basis for conclusions to enable reassessment when conditions change
- **Seek External Validation**: Subject analyses to challenge from stakeholders outside the analysis team

### Intelligence Gathering

- **Triangulate Sources**: Never rely on single sources for critical insights
- **Prioritize Primary Sources**: Direct competitor communications, job postings, and patents often reveal more than secondary analysis
- **Monitor Digital Footprints**: Website changes, job postings, social media, and press releases provide real-time signals

### Strategic Recommendation Mistakes
